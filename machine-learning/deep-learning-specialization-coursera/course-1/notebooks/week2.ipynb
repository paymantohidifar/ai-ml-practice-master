    "\n",
    "The line of Python code `w = copy.deepcopy(w)` creates a **completely independent copy** of the object `w`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down why this is important and what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is `copy.deepcopy()`?**\n",
    "    * Python's `copy` module provides functions for creating copies of objects.\n",
    "    * `copy.deepcopy()` performs a **deep copy**. This means it not only copies the object itself but also recursively copies all objects contained within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why use `deepcopy` instead of a simple assignment (`w = w`) or a shallow copy (`w = copy.copy(w)`)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Simple Assignment (`w = w`):** This doesn't create a copy at all. It simply makes another variable name (`w`) point to the *exact same object* in memory. Any changes made through either variable will affect the other because they are referencing the identical object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Shallow Copy (`w = copy.copy(w)`):** A shallow copy creates a new object, but it inserts references into the new object to the *original objects* found in the original. If the original object contains other mutable objects (like lists or dictionaries), the shallow copy will still share those nested objects with the original. Changing a nested mutable object in the copy will also change it in the original, and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Deep Copy (`w = copy.deepcopy(w)`):** This is where `deepcopy` shines. It creates a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts *copies* of the objects found in the original into the new one. This ensures that the new object and all its nested objects are entirely separate from the original. Changes made to the deep copy will **never** affect the original object, and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In essence, `w = copy.deepcopy(w)` is used when you need to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Modify a complex data structure** (like a list of lists, a dictionary of dictionaries, or custom objects) without altering the original.\n",
    "2.  **Preserve the original state** of an object while experimenting with modifications on a separate version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Assignment:** Giving someone a key to your house. They can change anything inside.\n",
    "* **Shallow Copy:** Making a photocopy of a binder. The pages are new, but if a page contains a smaller, nested binder, that smaller binder is still the original one.\n",
    "* **Deep Copy:** Making a photocopy of a binder, and then photocopying *every single page* and *every single item* within any nested binders, creating entirely new, separate copies of everything. 📄\n",
