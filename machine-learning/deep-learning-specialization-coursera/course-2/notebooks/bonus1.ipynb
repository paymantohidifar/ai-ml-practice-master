    "## Tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "A **tensor** is the fundamental data structure in TensorFlow. In the context of TensorFlow, a tensor is essentially a **multi-dimensional array** or **list of numbers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the primary unit used to represent all data within a TensorFlow program, including inputs, outputs, model parameters, and intermediate results of calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tensor Structure and Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors are simply generalizations of concepts you might already be familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mathematical Name | Rank (Dimensions) | TensorFlow Analogy | Example |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Scalar** | 0-D | A single number | `7` |\n",
    "| **Vector** | 1-D | A list of numbers | `[1, 2, 3]` |\n",
    "| **Matrix** | 2-D | A table of numbers (rows and columns) | `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` |\n",
    "| **3-Tensor** | 3-D | A cube or stack of matrices | `[[[...], [...]]]` |\n",
    "| **N-Tensor** | N-D | A data structure with N axes | Images (4-D), Video (5-D) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties of a Tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "Every tensor in TensorFlow is defined by three main properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Rank (or Axis):** The number of dimensions the tensor has. A rank-3 tensor has three axes.\n",
    "2.  **Shape:** The size of the tensor along each dimension. For example, a $2 \\times 3$ matrix has a shape of `(2, 3)`.\n",
    "3.  **Data Type (DType):** The type of data contained in the tensor's elements, such as `tf.float32`, `tf.int64`, or `tf.bool`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role in TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, tensors serve as the **data carriers** that flow through the computational graph (the \"flow\" in TensorFlow). Every operation (such as addition, matrix multiplication, or ReLU activation) takes one or more tensors as input and produces one or more tensors as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input Data:** Images, text data, and numeric features are loaded and represented as tensors.\n",
    "* **Model Weights:** Trainable parameters (weights and biases) are stored as **`tf.Variable`** objects, which are special, mutable types of tensors.\n",
    "* **Calculations:** All mathematical operations performed during training and inference are tensor operations."
