    "## Computer Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "In this introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the focus is on the transformative power of computer vision and the technical necessity of convolutions when dealing with high-resolution image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance and Impact of Computer Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rapid Advancement:** Deep learning has propelled computer vision into real-world utility, enabling self-driving cars, advanced face recognition, and relevant content curation in consumer apps.\n",
    "* **Cross-Fertilization:** Architectural innovations in computer vision often inspire breakthroughs in other fields, such as speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Computer Vision Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Image Classification:** Determining whether an object (e.g., a cat) is present in an image.\n",
    "* **Object Detection:** Not only identifying objects but also determining their specific positions and drawing bounding boxes around them.\n",
    "* **Neural Style Transfer:** Repainting a content image in the artistic style of a reference image (e.g., turning a landscape photo into a \"Picasso\" style painting).\n",

    "<img src='images/cv.png' width=750px>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge of Input Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Small Images:** A $64 \\times 64$ RGB image has 12,288 features ($64 \\times 64 \\times 3$), which is manageable for standard fully connected networks.\n",
    "* **Large Images:** A modest $1000 \\times 1000$ (1-megapixel) image results in 3,000,000 input features.\n",
    "* **Parameter Explosion:** * In a fully connected layer with just 1,000 hidden units, a 1-megapixel input would require a weight matrix with 3 billion parameters.\n",
    "* **Overfitting:** With billions of parameters, models are highly prone to overfitting without massive amounts of data.\n",
    "* **Resource Constraints:** The memory and computational power required to train such a network are generally infeasible for standard hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/input_scale.png' width=750px>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Convolutional Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "* To process high-resolution images efficiently without a parameter explosion, deep learning uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.\n",
    "* **Convolutions:** This operation is the fundamental building block of CNNs, allowing the network to learn local patterns (like edges) while drastically reducing the number of parameters compared to fully connected layers."
